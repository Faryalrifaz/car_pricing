# 🚗 Car Price Data Analysis – Learning in Progress

Hi! I'm currently taking the **Data Analysis with Python** course on Coursera and this project is a part of my hands-on learning  
I'm exploring a dataset related to car prices to understand how different factors influence the price of a car

This repo includes my **in-progress notebooks** where I’ve applied data cleaning, basic analysis, and visualizations using Python libraries

##  What I’ve Done So Far:
- Loaded and explored the dataset  
- Cleaned missing values and formatted data  
- Performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Created visualizations to find trends and correlations  

##  Tools & Libraries:
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📁 Files:
- `01_import_and_preprocessing.ipynb` – Data overview, missing value handling  
- `02_descriptive_statistics.ipynb` – Plots, trends, correlation heatmap  
- `Data/` – Raw dataset used

##  Still in Progress:
- More visualizations and deeper insights  
- Possibly adding modeling later once I complete the course

This is part of my learning journey  
Feel free to explore, learn with me, or suggest improvements!
